Welcome to the Java Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) repository! 🚀 This repo contains a collection of fundamental and advanced DSA implementations in Java, designed to help learners and professionals improve their problem-solving skills and understanding of computer science concepts.

Features ✨
Data Structures 📊: Implementations of arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees (binary tree, binary search tree, AVL tree), heaps, hashmaps, graphs, and more.
Algorithms 🧠: Covers searching (binary search, linear search), sorting (bubble sort, merge sort, quicksort), dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, graph algorithms (Dijkstra, BFS, DFS), and more.
Code Efficiency ⚡: Optimized solutions with time and space complexity analysis.
Explanations and Comments 💬: Clear comments and explanations for how each algorithm works.
Practice Problems 📝: Includes problems to practice and challenges to help you strengthen your skills.

Files and Descriptions 📂
BinaryTree.java 🌳
Implements a binary tree data structure, which stores values in a hierarchical structure for efficient searching and traversal.

Hashmap.java 🔑📦
Implements hashing using key-value pairs, providing efficient lookups, insertions, and deletions based on hash codes.

Quicksort.java ⚡
Implements the quicksort sorting algorithm, a divide-and-conquer algorithm with an average time complexity of O(n log n).

README.md 📝
Updated documentation for the repository.

Twosum.java ➕
Implements a solution for the Two Sum problem, which finds two numbers in an array that add up to a specific target sum.

LinkedList.java 🔗
Implements a linked list, a linear data structure where each element points to the next, allowing for efficient insertions and deletions.

Mergesort.java 🔄
Implements the merge sort sorting algorithm, a stable, divide-and-conquer algorithm with a time complexity of O(n log n).

MergingofArray.java ➗
Implements the merging of two sorted arrays into a single sorted array.

Recursion.java 🔁
Implements a recursive function that calls itself until a base case is met, demonstrating the concept of recursion.

Timestock.java ⏳
Likely implements a time-tracking or timestamp-related functionality (description unclear from the name).
