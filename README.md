# Java

This repository contains a collection of fundamental and advanced Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) implemented in Java. It is designed to help learners and professionals alike understand the essential concepts of computer science and improve their problem-solving skills.

Features
Data Structures: Includes implementations of arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees (binary tree, binary search tree, AVL tree), heaps, hashmaps, graphs, and more.
Algorithms: Covers searching (binary search, linear search), sorting (bubble sort, merge sort, quicksort), dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, graph algorithms (Dijkstra, BFS, DFS), and more.
Code Efficiency: Optimized solutions with time and space complexity analysis.
Explanations and Comments: Each implementation comes with clear comments and explanations of how the algorithm works.
Practice Problems: Includes problems for practice and challenges to improve your understanding.
Directory Structure
/src: Contains all the Java source code files for data structures and algorithms.
/docs: Provides explanations and tutorials for each data structure and algorithm.
/tests: Includes test cases to validate the correctness of the implemented algorithms.
